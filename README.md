### :octocat: Hi everyone, that's me Jonathan!

:wave: :wave: I'm a Python self-taught and entusiastic who likes code and build little things which will be posted on this account. Looking to build something phenomenal that will help people.

#### :dart: Goals for the rest of the year (2020).
For the rest of the year I have decided to focus 100% on learning Python and Django. I will also start working on the basis of a project I have in mind.
